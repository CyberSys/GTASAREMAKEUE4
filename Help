introduction

many actions, relationships or information are stored inside .csv files. They are found in *data/ .
to create a file you can simply follow these instructions:
https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Gameplay/DataDriven/index.html
These instructions don't cover all information but it is possible to import color-,vector-and scalarcurves, gameplay
data, reference all kinds of files that are available in ue4.

performance
it is blazingly fast to iterate over the data tables, having thousand of rows inside a data table is no problem, 
it is lazily loaded, thus allowing to load just specific information or assets.

example usage
1. cause referencing assets inside those files is possible it is easy as pie to spawn any pawn in the world by 
using commands/name variables. eg. *data/bp_parked_car_generator has the function *set_parked_car that takes in
three variables:
'name' (desired car)
'vector' (spawn location)
'float' (spawn z-rotation)
it spawns any car that is referenced inside the file *data/vehicle/dat_vehicle. the blueprint is position in the persistent
world and can be triggered from anywhere, thus cars that are spawned this way are also spawned in the world and are not 
depending on the level streaming system. the car might not spawn in levels that are unloaded are fall through the world as soon 
a sub level gets unloaded because of missing collisions. in future a kill volume shall take controll over this to destroy such
a pawn or the pawn shall be unloaded if too far away from all players.
